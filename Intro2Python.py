# ---HOW TO PREPARE YOUR COMPUTER---
#       FOR THIS WORKSHOP
#
# ---STEP 1. INSTALLING SPYDER ---
# What is Spyder?
# A PYTHON IDE BUILT FOR ANALYZING DATA.
# Install Spyder from this sites:
# https://www.spyder-ide.org/

# ---STEP 2. STORE WORKSHOP FILES---
#
# In your "Documents" folder,
# create a new folder named "Intro2Python"
# unzip the files and store them there.
# 
# Run Spyder and open Intro2Python.py file.

# ---STEP 3. INSTALL ADD-ON PACKAGES---
#       
# A Python package refers to a directory of Python 
# module(s). A module in python is a .py file that 
# defines one or more function/classes which you 
# intend to reuse in different codes of your program.
# Use PIP to install a package either in a command prompt 
# window or in the python command line.
# To use them, we import them. Submodeles can be stored 
# in packages, and accessed with dot syntax.
# Some packages, such as sys and os, have already installed
# in python, you do not need to install again. We can import
# it directly.
# Official Python description of modules and importing them:
# https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html
# Check where is python installed and used by Rodeo/Spyder
import sys
print(sys.executable)

# Install a package using CMD
# Python Path\python -m pip install seaborn patsy statsmodels
# For example:
# C:\Users\XZHU8\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\python -m pip install seaborn patsy statsmodels

# If you want to update the python path, 
# click Tools -> Preference.
# Find the Python interpreter and click 
# Check Use the following python interpreter

# Start Spyder, and open this file by
# going to the "File" menu and choosing
# "Open file". 
# Use pip.main(['install', 'Library name')
# function to install a package. Select the following 
# lines and click "Run Line".
# Do this only one time after you install Spyder:
import pip

# Check the version of pip
print("pip", pip.__version__)
# If pip's version is under 10.0, use the following code to
# install seaborn, pasty and statsmodels packages
pip.main(['install', 'numpy', 'scipy', 'seaborn', 'patsy', 'statsmodels'])

# If pip's version is more than 10.0, like current is 18.0, 
# use the following code to install seaborn, pasty and statsmodels.
from pip._internal import main
main(['install', 'numpy', 'scipy', 'seaborn', 'patsy', 'statsmodels'])

# Update a pacakge installed using pip
import pip
# pip version <10.0, upgrade a package, like pip
pip.main(['install', '--upgrade', 'pip'])
# pip version >=10.0, upgrade a package, like seaborn
from pip._internal import main
main(['install', '--upgrade', 'seaborn'])

# Show all of the packages installed under Python
import pkg_resources
packages = [d for d in pkg_resources.working_set]
packages

# ---STEP 4. TEST YOUR INSTALLATION---
#
# Open this file in Spyder,
# select the following commands
# and click "Run Current Cell" or "Run Current Line". If you see
# the output, you're set.
# If not, don't worry, you can watch
# the workshop and fix this later.
#
import os
import sys
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp
import seaborn as sns
import statsmodels as sms

print('Python version ' + sys.version)
print('Pandas version: ' + pd.__version__)
print('Matplotlib version ' + matplotlib.__version__)
print('Numpy version: ' + np.__version__)
print('Scipy version: ' + sp.__version__)
print('Seaborn version ' + sns.__version__)
print('Statsmodels version ' + sms.__version__)

# ---GOOD SOURCES OF PYTHON HELP---

# UT people get 15 hours per semester of 
# free help in 540 Greve Hall:
#
#   HelpDesk: 974-9900
#   Walk-in Schedule: 
#   http://oit.utk.edu/research/schedule

# ---RUNNING PYTHON COMMANDS---
#
# As you've done above, you can
# Use File> Open or File> New 
# to enter Python commands into a 
# "script" file and run them.
#
# You can also enter commands one at a time
# in the terminal window at the bottom left.
# Do this sparingly as you can't save 
# commands easily.

# ---TERMINAL WINDOW PROMPTS---
#
# ">>>" is the standard command prompt 
#
# "..." is the prompt when continuing on a new line
#
# If you see "..." prompt when not trying to 
# continue, look for a missing ")"
#
# To get rid of an unexpected "..." continuation 
# prompt
#   -Submit the missing piece of the command, or 
#    use Ctrl+C


# ---DOCUMENTING YOUR PROGRAMS---

# Comments go from "#" to the end of the line


# ---IMPORTING A PACKAGE TO PYTHON ---
#
# You only install a package once,
# but you need to import it from the package 
# each time when you start python
#
# I do it repeatedly in this workshop to 
# emphasize that a package is being used.
# 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

# ---FINDING FILES---
#
# To tell Python the folder to read from or
# write to, set your "working directory" (wd)
#
# This sets it from your Documents folder:
import os
print(os.getcwd()) # Prints the working directory


# Set the working directory:

# python path use "/" or "\\" instead of "\"
# put a r before the path string without using / or \\.

os.chdir(r"C:\Users\XZHU8\Documents\Intro2python") # Provide the path here

# Note put "r" before the path by using "copy path" in windows
# or use of forward slash or double backward slashes ("/" or "\\")

# Show the work directory again:
print(os.getcwd()) 

# ---ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR--- 
#
# When creating objects, you give them
# values using the assignment operator
# "=" as here:

mydata = pd.read_csv("mydata.csv")
mydata.head()

#---PYTHON VARIABLES---
#
# Python's variable Types:
# Number (int, long, float, Complex)
# String
# Boolean
# List
# Tuple
# Dictionary
# We focus on list today. For details, see
# https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm
# Example
x =  1 
type(x)

a = "string"
type(a)

# create a list
# A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]).
# Variables can be mixed types in a list.
mixlist = ["a", 1]
mixlist
# Note: first item's index is 0 not 1.
id = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# Show the first item of id.
id[0]
id[7]

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
img=mpimg.imread('apples.png')
imgplot = plt.imshow(img)
plt.show()
# Tuples:Like lists, contains several items enclosed within parenthesis.
# but immutable, and usually used for smaller sequences
# of things that are related to each other.
# Think of Cartesian coordinates:(x, y, z)
# The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed 
# unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.
aTuple = ("foo", "bar")
len(aTuple)

# Following action is not valid for tuples
# aTuple[0] = 100
aTuple[0] = 100
# list can be changed.
alist=["foo", "bar"]
alist[0] = 100
alist

# Dicitonairy: A collection of variables indexed by other, "key" variables.
# Instead of using numeric or default index in python, if you want to 
# create your own index, you need to use dictionary.
aDict = {}
aDict["a"] = 364936
aDict["b"] = 12.4 
aDict[7] = "hi"

aDict
aDict["a"]
aDict["b"]
aDict[7]

# Keywords: reserved words in python. 
# Cannot be used as a variable name.
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

# ---OBJECTS & THEIR NAMES---
#
# Python is object oriented
#
# Everything: data, functions (procedures), models,
# etc. are objects, with its properties/attributes 
# and methods/functions.
#
# The object names should begin with a letter 
# and can contain letters, numbers, 
# underscores. 
# But cannot have space or period. 
# Case matters, e.g. myvar is not MyVar
# 

# ---OBJECT ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS--- 
#
# To access an attributes or a method, use dot syntax. 
mydata.workshop

# For example, mean() is a method of a dataframe 
mydata.mean()

# list all the attributes and methods of mydata.
dir(mydata)

# ---PYTHON FUNCTIONS---

# As you already know, Python gives you many built-in 
# functions e.g. print(mydata), dir(), type()

# When you use a function, you "call" its name.
#
# print() is the default function
#   so this function call:  print(q1) 

print(mydata)

# ---NESTING FUNCTIONS---
#
# You can create a variable in
# one step and use it in others
#
import numpy as np
mydata['logq1'] = np.log(mydata['q1'])
np.sum(mydata['logq1'])
#
# or you can "nest" one function
# call within another:
#
np.sum(np.log(mydata['q1']))


# ---USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS---
#
# Parameters/keywords in a function are called "arguments"
# Arguments follow function name in parentheses
# and are separated by commas
#
# In python, user-defined functions can take four
# different types of arguments. The argument types
# and their meanings, however, are pre-defined and
# canâ€™t be changed. a function is defined using 
# the def keyword, and use indentation
# to define the content of the function.
# The content indents four spaces.
# Use Tab key as the shortcut 
# The colon is used to declare the start of an indented block. 
# When we need to use indentation:
#    if/else statement
#    for/while statement
#    def statement
#    class statement 
# 
# example:
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
# Calling a function
# To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
my_function()

# examples
def my_function_with_args(username, greeting):
    print("Hello, {} , From My Function!, I wish you {}!".format(username, greeting))
    
#prints - "Hello, Julia, From My Function!, I wish you a great year!"
my_function_with_args("Mary", "a great year")


#---FUNCTION OUTPUT---
#  
#  Returning a value from a function, Not only can 
#  you pass a parameter value into a function, a function 
#  can also produce a value, i.e., Output.
#  For example, 
len(id)
#
#  That value is a single object that may contain
#  much information (e.g. data frame, list)
#
#  Example
def square(x):
    y = x * x
    return y

result = square(10)
result
# Notice: Cannot use print to return a value

#---CONDITION STATEMENTS---
#
# In the real world, we commonly must evaluate information 
# around us and then choose one course of action or another
# based on what we observe: For example,
#
# If the weather is nice, then Iâ€™ll mow the lawn.
# Otherwise, I wonâ€™t mow.
#
#   if/else-statement 
#   if/elif/else-statement 
#
# Blocks of code under if statements are executed as long 
# as the stated condition is true.
# Can have elif (which is a contraction of "else if") and/or
# else statements associated, when the condition is not true. 

# Here is an if/else-statement example:
weather = str(input('How is the weather today, nice or not? '))
if weather == "nice":           
    print('I will mow the Lawn')
else:
    print("I won't mow the Lawn")
    

# If/elif/else statement example,
i = 1
j = 2
if i + j == 3:
    print("three")
elif i + j == 2:
    print("two")
else:
    print("neither!")

# Create a function
    
def checkNumber(i, j): 
    if i + j == 3:
        print("three")
    elif i + j == 2:
        print("two")
    else:
        print("neither!")

checkNumber(1, 1)
checkNumber(10, 1)

# ---TABLE OF LOGICAL COMPARISONS---
#
# Equals              ==
# Less than           <
# Greater than        >
# Less or equal       <=
# Greater or equal    >=
# Not equal           !=
# And                 &
# Or                  |
# 0<=x<=1             (x >= 0) & (x <=1)


# --- ITERATION---
#
# Iteration is typically done by means of a loop, 
# being a piece of code that is executed repeatedly.
# We can control how often a loop repeats, or whether it repeats at all, 
# with control flow statements, which evaluates conditions. 
# Control flow statements can control more than just loops. 
# For more control flow statements, see
# https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/controlflow.html

# --FOR STATEMENT---
#
# Blocks of code under for statements repeat themselves for each 
# elements of some iterable object. They make a for loop.
# Iterable objects are those that have a defined sequence of zero or more objects.
# e.g. lists, strings, tuples, etc.
namelist = ["Bob", "Josh", "Cary","Michael","Rochelle", "Sun"]

for name in namelist:
    print ("Hello, " + name + "!")


aText = "Hello world!"

for l in aText:
    print(l)

#---RANGE FUNCTION---
#
# Often we want to repeat an action some specified number of 
# times, rather than over a collection of objects.
# The range() function returns an iterable object of numbers, of size
#(and optionally, starting value and increment) you ask for. In python,
# we iterate on that.
# Ask for a range of itegers, starting at zero and ending before 7. 
aRange =  range(7)
for i in aRange:
    print(str(i))

for i in range(3, 7): # start at 3 end before 7
    print(str(i))

for i in range(2, 12, 3): #start at 2, end before 12, increment by 3
    print(str(i)) 
    

# ---WHILE STATEMENT ---
# Blocks of code under while statements repeat themselves until a
# specified condition is detected as false - they make a while loop.
# Before the indented block is (re)run, the condition is evaluated. It
# runs only if the condition is true. 

i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(str(i) + " is less than 10")
    i = i + 1

i
# If we left out the increment, 1 could always be <10,
# and we'd get an infinite loop.
# Use Ctrl+C to terminate a loop.
